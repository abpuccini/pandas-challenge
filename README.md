### Analysis

Based on the City School data, statistic data and tables, the analysis will be presented as following:

Refer to the Scores by **School Spending** table, schools that spend on their budget on each student **less** seem to have **better performance** than schools that spend more money on each student.

Refer to the Scores by **School Size**, there is a significant difference of school's performance between schools that have less than 2,000 students and more than 2,000 students. The **bigger size** schools tend to have **lower performance**.

Refer to the Scores by **School Type**, **Charter** school tend to has **better performance** than District school.
